Teaching Assistance
üìò Project Overview

This project aims to create a predictive model that helps teachers identify and analyze the performance of students.
It provides insights into key factors influencing student performance and supports teachers in taking data-driven decisions to improve learning outcomes.

üß† Objective

To develop a machine learning model that predicts student performance based on academic and behavioral data.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

üßÆ Steps in the Project

Import Libraries

Imported required Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

Load the Dataset

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Checked for missing values and understood data types.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing data by filling or removing them.

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored the data distribution and relationships between features.

Used visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to identify patterns.

Model Building

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Applied machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Trained the models on the training dataset.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Compared results to select the best-performing model.

Prediction

Used the trained model to predict student performance on new or unseen data.

Conclusion

The predictive model helps teachers identify students who may need additional support and improve overall performance outcomes.
